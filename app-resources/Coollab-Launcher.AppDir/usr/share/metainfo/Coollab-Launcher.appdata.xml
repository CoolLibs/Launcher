        <summary>A node-based software to create visual effects and generative-art</summary>
        <description>
Coollab's main goal is to be as intuitive and easy to use as possible. Effects are high-level and they just work out of the box! You don't need to know any math or programming to make your own very cool effects! (Although having those skills allows you to do some advanced stuff).
Start with any image or shape, like your Webcam, add any modifier on top of it, like a Kaleidoscope, and you already have some cool results. You can then play with the 100s of effects to change the color, distort the image, add particles, react to audio, and much more!
Coollab can be used for VJing, exporting videos, creating interactive installations, etc.!
